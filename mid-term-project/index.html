            <h3><u>ADDENDUM</u></h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Game Design:</h4>
                <p>I structured the game as a text-based adventure with multiple levels, each presenting the player
                    with choices that lead to different outcomes. The storyline revolves around escaping a haunted
                    house, with various spooky scenarios and twists
                    to keep the player engaged.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>HTML Structure:</h4>
                <p>I organized the HTML file to have separate sections for the start screen, game screen, and footer.
                    This separation helps maintain clarity and allows for easy manipulation of content through
                    JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>CSS Styling:</h4>
                <p>The CSS file was designed to give the game a dark, eerie aesthetic, fitting the theme of a haunted
                    house. I utilized responsive design principles to ensure the game looks good on different screen
                    sizes.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>JavaScript Functionality:</h4>
                <p>JavaScript was used to handle the game logic, including rendering levels, processing player choices,
                    and managing game state.</p>
                <p>I implemented a dynamic rendering system to display text, choices, and images based on the current
                    game level.</p>
                <p>Endgame scenarios were handled to display appropriate messages (either success or failure) and offer
                    the option to restart the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
                <p>One challenge was managing the complexity of the game's branching storyline. I addressed this by
                    carefully structuring the level data and using conditional rendering to handle different outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>Ensuring smooth transitions between levels and maintaining a coherent narrative flow required
                    meticulous testing and debugging.</p>
                <p>Integrating dynamic content such as the last modified date in the footer involved understanding DOM
                    manipulation and JavaScript's Date object.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Insights Gained:</h4>
                <p>Developing this game reinforced the importance of clear code organization and separation of concerns,
                    especially in projects with multiple interconnected components.
                </p>
                <p>I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling
                    techniques.</p>
                <p>Testing and iteration were crucial for refining the player experience and identifying and fixing any
                    bugs or inconsistencies.</p>
