            <li><b>meta:</b> Meta tag provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character set and viewport
                settings.</li>
            <li><b>title:</b> Title tag sets the title of the HTML document, displayed on the browser tab or window.
            </li>
            <li><b>body:</b> Body tag contains the content of the HTML document, including text, images, links, and all
                other elements.</li>
            <li><b>article:</b> In the first article tag, I have placed the entire content of the page.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the first section of the Resume which contains my name and contact information, I have taken a
                    div tag to place this information so that the entire information will be present in a single block
                    and used h1 tag for my name so that the name will be in highlighted text and placed the contact
                    information in a paragraph tag.</li>
                <li>In the next block/section which is regarding the Professional Summary, a div tag is used to place
                    this professional summary information in a separate block. I used h2 tag to highlight the heading
                    and used a paragraph tag for mentioning the summary information.</li>
                <li>Moving on to the Skills section, again I used a div tag to write the skills information in a
                    separate block where skills heading is highlighted with h2 tag and I have mentioned all the skills
                    in an unordered list. As there are more number of skills in my resume which cannot be fit in a
                    single line, I separated the skills in 2 unordered lists by using ul and li tags. Also, I gave the
                    styling to these two unordered lists
                    inroder to display the skills in a row instead of a column.</li>
                <li>Now, coming to my Work Experience Section, I have mentioned it in a separate div block and the
                    heading is given in h2 tag like all other headings in my resume. I have work experience working in 3
                    different
                    companies so I mentioned information about each one in a div block. In each inner div tag, I used h3
                    tag and ul tags, where my job title and company name is mentioned in h3 tag and my roles and
                    responsibilities are mentioned in ul (unordered list) tag so that the info will look good in bullet
                    points. Similarly, I used the same format/tags to mention the work experience in the other 2
                    companies. Also, I have given the key points of my roles and responsibilites in bold text.
                </li>
                <li>Coming to the final section of my resume which is regarding the Education, which is also mentioned
                    in a separate div block like other sections. I have given the heading Education in h3 tag and
                    each qualification in a separate (inner block) div tag. My qualification is mentioned in h4 heading
                    tag and also in italic form using the 'i' tag. Also, I used an unordered list to specify the other
                        details like branch, college name, Grade points and course duration. I have highlighted the grade points by giving it within bold tag.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the second article tag, I have placed the addendum which has the information of all the tags.</li>
            <li>In the footer section, I have placed the code mentioned in the assignment description. </li>
        </ul>
